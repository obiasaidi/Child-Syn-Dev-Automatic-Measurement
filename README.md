# Children Syntactic Development
This project aims to create an automated measurement of the development of children syntactic acquisition using The Growing Tree approach

## Data Cleaning
1. cleanch.py contains a list of functions to clean noises in childes files
2. utils.py contains another list of functions to clean noises in childes files
3. clean_brown_mw contains the code to clean childes data from Brown and MacWhinney corpora

   I use two different functions to clean Brown and MacWhinney due to their different characteristic patterns; preprocess for Brown and Clean for MacWhinney
